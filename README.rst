General terms
-------------

process (German: Prozess)
    A participation process includes a broader audience in a combination of one
    or more methods to debate and/or make a decision on a specific topic.

    A process resource in online participation is used to document the whole
    participation process. It thereby makes progress evident to the audience
    and safeguards the results.

    Processes usually have clearly defined properties: A fixed period of time
    (possibly permanent), topic/goal, target audience, location (where
    applicable).

method / tool (German: Methode / Werkzeug)
    A method is a formalized way to collaborate in order to reach a common goal.
    A tool is a software that implements a specific method. In our context they
    can be used synonymously.

    In one process, content may be transfered from one method to another or
    even worked on with different methods at the same time (e.g. online and
    offline).

    Different software solutions have different approaches on how to build
    processes from individual methods.

phases (German: Phase)
    A process is typically structured as a progression of phases. The end of
    each phase marks a milestone with intermediary result that can be build
    upon in the next phases.

    The end of a phase can be determined by several factors, e.g. a fixed date,
    a quorum, or an admin action.

    Phases can also have significant impact on the features that are available
    to users.

    All processes have an announce phase before and a result phase after the
    participation.

    Note that phases are most common on processes, but may also exist on
    smaller entities such as methods or even individual proposal.

idea collection (German: Ideensammlung)
    An idea collection is typically structured as a process for collecting ideas.


About this document
===================

This document contains a common glossary for online participation projects. It
attempts to provide easy-to-read definitions that form the greatest common
denominator between different software projects. It does not:

-   Try to invent new concepts.
-   Describe terms that are so general that wikipedia (or some other place)
    provides a good definition.
-   Describe terms that are so specific that they are not applicable to all (or
    most) related software projects.
-   Describe implementation details, even if they are shared across projects.

If you edit this document, please stick to the following guidelines:

-   Use 4 spaces for indentation and keep lines at 80 characters at maximum.
-   Write valid `restructedText
    <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ without sphinx extensions
    (github ignores them).
-   Write English, but always provide a German translation for the term.
-   To propose a change, please create a pull request at `github
    <https://github.com/liqd/liqd-glossary/edit/master/README.rst>`_.
